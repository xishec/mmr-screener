- **Volume / Avg**: Higher volume multiples (e.g., > 2) might indicate strong momentum.
- **Close / SMA50 & Close / SMA200**: Seeking ratios > 1.1 suggests uptrend.
- **SMA50 / SMA150 & SMA50 / SMA200**: Ratios > 1.05 often signal stronger momentum.
- **SMA150 / SMA200**: Ideally > 1.02 for continued growth.
